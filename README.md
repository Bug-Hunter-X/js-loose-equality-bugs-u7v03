This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating a potential bug caused by loose equality comparison using the == operator.  The bug arises from unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types.  The solution demonstrates how to use the strict equality operator (===) to avoid this issue.  This is a common pitfall for beginners in JavaScript and illustrates the importance of careful type checking.
